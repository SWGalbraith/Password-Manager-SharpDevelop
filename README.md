# Password-Manager-SharpDevelop

A simple Password Management Desktop app to keep your passwords nice and organsed!

The app can be installed on an external disk to be used portably, as it uses no data outside of its own installation folder.

Passwords are encrypted using a combination of the AES Cipher and scrambling encrypted data. Encryption is controlled via a master password for the application.

This app has been modified from its VS-2010 counterpart to allow developers to work with it using the Open-Source .NET IDE, SharpDevelop. SharpDevelop can be found here: http://www.icsharpcode.net/opensource/sd/
